These are my unimplemented ideas about this project. If you have more, feel free to email me/send a PR with this file changed.

Feel free to implement any of these (or your own idea) and send a PR, I'll be more than happy to look at it.

- use hosted bootstrap, jquery, et al.
- implement a cache layer
- add error handling if $_GET parameters are missing in various files
- Refactor the codebase (long lines, etc.)
- Linkify albums in tab 3 of takeouts to link to the actual album in the social network
- Show number of comments int he polaroid
- Add an option to transfer comments as plain text
- Add an option to delete a photo (place an x on the polaroid).
- Add an option to transfer or operate on multiple photos (delete, etc.) - place a check box on the polaroid
- consider replacing photo fetching by just passing the url (fb supports it. not sure of others)
- handle instagram API pagination correctly
- add user switching ability
- add support for multiple users so that you can transfer between two different facebook accounts.
- Add help hover near "signed in as vignesh" to show how to sign in as a different user.
